Get all files with certain .extensions run it against a wordlist which I create, 

assume all urls are .extensions through previous recon tools

have it also able to accept a single file if it has certain extensions

make it accept certain extensions so the output is in ".ext" format

TODO: 
create wordlists - js and php created
create the script - script works but need to make it capable of accept flags (single file or filelist) 

curl https://shop.lululemon.com/static/gi/scripts/gi-cpra.js | grep --color=always "return" > test.txt

Test code for wordlist file scan (.php)
cat "Test/Vulnerable.php" | grep --color=always -f ~/Desktop/bountyhunt/wordlists/Extensions/PHP/php-all.txt | tee "test_result.txt" 


strips out the functions test(function-arg) -> test(
cat wordlists/Extensions/PHP/php-all.txt | sed 's/).*//g'
